- **WORKAROUNDS.md** - For AI agents to track SDK integration issues and technical debt of the FireGen Extension
- **LLMS.md** - For AI agents consuming/integrating FireGen Extension into their applications (API reference, job schemas)
- **AGENTS.md** (this file) - Working directory rules for AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)

## Rules

- Use TypeScript as possible as you can, because TypeScript is preferred as primary language.
- Use `npx tsx` to run TypeScript code.
- package.json dependencies should be installed using `npm install` with `@latest` version
- never use keyword/pattern match to solve problems, always use AI semantic understanding
- when trying to solve a problem, always follow 1st principles thinking, break down the problem into smaller parts, and solve each part step-by-step. always search online for similar problems and solutions.
- Always use semantic understanding and AI-native techniques for prompt tagging and classification.
- use `zod` for schema definition and validation
- Never use hard-coded keyword/substring rule engines for prompt tagging or classification.
- create temp files in `/tmp` directory. i.e. log files, debug code files.
